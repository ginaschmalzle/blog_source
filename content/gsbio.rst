Hello! I'm Gina.
==================

I am an geodesist turned data scientist who is currently working at Nordstrom in Seattle, WA.  I spent about a decade studying the mechanics of earthquakes when I decided to make a career change into data science.  Since the transition, I have been working on a number of interesting data problems including product recommendations, as well as targeting and segmenting customers using a variety of machine learning techniques.

 I got my PhD at the `University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences <http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/>`_ in Miami FL. I was a postdoctoral scholar and research scientist at the `University of Washington <http://www.washington.edu/>`_ in Seattle, WA from 2009-2014.  I have an extensive background in tectonics of the west coast of the United States, including the San Andreas Fault, Eastern California Shear Zone and the `Cascadia Subduction Zone <http://geodesygina.com/Cascadia.html>`_.

 I am a co-owner of `BOS Technologies LLC <http://bostechnologies.com/>`_, specializing in high precision Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR).

In this blog you will find some interactive websites made for geophysical datasets.  Many geophysical datasets are publicly available, but it is difficult for the general public to use and play with these data. There are a few interactive web pages that I built with a little help from my friends at `Hacker School, NYC <www.hackerschool.com>`_.  The `Vector Projector <http://geodesygina.com/vectorprojector/vectorprojector.html>`_ is a nifty little tool we made that visualizes high precision GPS velocity fields that measure how much tectonic plates move over time.  The `Japan Earthquake Movie <http://geodesygina.com/JapanEarthquake/index.html>`_ is an animation showing the locations of the main shock and aftershocks of the 2011 Japan earthquake, that simultaneously plots with charts of magnitude versus time.

Thanks for reading my website!  I'd love to hear your thoughts, so `keep in touch`_!
