Hello! I'm Gina.
==================

I am a geodesist who recieved her PhD at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences in Miami FL.  Since then I have been a postdoctoral scholar and research scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA, and along with Scott Baker and Batuhan Osmanoglu, started a geodetic services company called BOS Technologies, LLC (http://bostechnologies.com/). We specialize in high precision Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR).   

I am currently attending Hacker School (https://www.hackerschool.com/) in downtown Manhatten, NYC, where I am working on developing interactive websites for geophysical datasets.  Many geophysical datasets are publicly available, but it is difficult for the general public to use and play with these data.  One of my goals here at Hacker School is to develop web based tools that allow users to explore these fascinating datasets.
