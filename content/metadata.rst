Hello World!

This is my first bog post generated by pelican and hosted by github with my snazzy new domain name geodesygina.com!  That is pronounced:
GEE-ODD-ESS-Y-GEE-NA.  Ha! I'm such a geek.

Anyway, thanks to Amy Hanlon who posted directions on how to set up a blog with Pelican at http://mathamy.com/.  

I purchased my domain name with godaddy.com.
