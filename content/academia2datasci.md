Summary: Thoughts on changing careers

I became a data scientist in 2014, after about a decade of being a geophysicist in academia.  Changing careers was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, and I'm often asked why I decided to make the switch.  In this post, I will talk a little about my experience, but I will also talk about the skills I learned in academia that were key in making the switch, as well as the skills I needed to improve.  Although I know that everyone's experience about getting into data science is different, I hope this blog will help others trying to get into the field.

## Academic Life as a Postdoc

I got my phd in 2008, and spent the next 6 years as a postdoc, struggling to get funding for my research, write papers and trying to find a stable job.  I started off strong with a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation.  However, 2008 was the start of the financial crisis.  After the NSF postdoc ended in 2010, federal funding in the sciences also became a lot harder to get. I found myself spending most of my time writing proposals to try to get grant money instead of focusing on writing papers, even during the NSF postdoc.  This was the start of a vicious downward spiral, since the more you write papers, the more likely you are to get funding.  If you are not producing papers, well -- you might just be out of luck unless another research group takes you in. In addition, I just got married and I was geographically restricted, so I could only look for jobs in and around the Seattle area.  Since there are very few jobs in geodesy world wide, this really limited my prospects.



I spent years trying to make it work.  In part it was because in the decade that I was an academic, I was groomed to stay in academia.  I was told that I could get a job in industry, but in my field that meant going to work for an oil company, which I wasn't very interested in.  I was not sure how to transition my skills to other industries, or even which skills were applicable, and I had no idea how to get a job in a field that I had no experience in.  But I knew it was time for a change.





This post reflects my own experience.  Have you made the switch from academia to data science?  I would love it if you added to the conversation in the comments section below.
