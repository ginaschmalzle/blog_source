Summary: Thoughts on changing careers

I became a data scientist in 2014, after about a decade of being a geophysicist in academia.  Changing careers was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, and I'm often asked why I decided to make the switch.  In this post, I will talk a little about my experience, but I will also talk about the skills I learned in academia that were key in making the switch, as well as the skills I needed to improve.




I got my phd in 2008, and spent the next 6 years as a postdoc, struggling to get funding for my research, write papers and trying find a stable job.  I know many of you can relate to this experience. I unfortunately was in a situation where I received very little support, meaning I had long stints of working hard, but not getting paid.

This post reflects my own experience.  Have you made the switch from academia to data science?  I would love it if you added to the conversation in the comments section below.
