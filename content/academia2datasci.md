Summary: Thoughts on changing careers

I became a data scientist in 2014, after about a decade of being a geophysicist in academia.  Changing careers was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, and I'm often asked why I decided to make the switch.  In this post, I will talk a little about my experience, but I will also talk about the skills I learned in academia that were key in making the switch, as well as the skills I needed to improve.  Although I know that everyone's experience about getting into data science is different, I hope this blog will help others trying to get into the field.

## Academic Life as a Postdoc

I got my phd in 2008, and spent the next 6 years as a postdoc, struggling to get funding for my research, write papers and trying to find a stable job.  I started off strong with a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation.  However, 2008 was the start of the financial crisis.  After the NSF postdoc ended in 2010, federal funding in the sciences also became a lot harder to get. I found myself spending most of my time writing proposals to try to get grant money instead of focusing on writing papers, even during the NSF postdoc.  This was the start of a vicious downward spiral, since the more you write papers, the more likely you are to get funding.  If you are not producing papers, well -- you might just be out of luck unless another research group takes you in. In addition, I just got married and I was geographically restricted, so I could only look for jobs in and around the Seattle area.  Since there are very few jobs in geodesy world wide, this really limited my prospects.

I spent years trying to make it work.  In part it was because in the decade that I was an academic, I was groomed to stay in academia. At least at that time, academics were taught how to become future academics, but were not taught about alternative jobs. 'Alternative' jobs included working for the government, which was also hard to do in the economic climate. I was told that I could get a job in industry, but in my field that meant going to work for an oil company, which I wasn't interested in.  

Compounding the issue for all academics, was the number of new phd's given compared to the number of tenure track positions available.

From 1982 to 2011, approximately 800,000 STEM PhDs were awarded, however only 100,000 academic faculty positions were available (Figure 1).  In addition, the number of STEM PhDs awarded per year since 1982 has increased year over year, from ~19,000 to ~36,000 in 2011. The number of new faculty positions year over year remained about the same, at about 3,000 per year (Figure 1).

It took me years to realize that continuing in my field was actually not going to work for me, and it terrified me that I could potentially be starting over again in a new field, especially since I spent so much time as a geophysicist, and I was no longer a spring chicken.

## The Day(s) of Reckoning
I knew it was time for a change. I was not sure how to transition my skills to other industries, or even which skills were applicable. I had no idea how to get a job in a field that I had no experience in, and I was even unsure about what kind of job I wanted.  So many questions...

What really helped me understand what I should focus on was creating a list of things that I liked about academia, and a separate list of things that I didn't like.  




This post reflects my own experience.  Have you made the switch from academia to data science?  Are you thinking about making the change?  I would love it if you added to the conversation in the comments section below.
